**Lab Exercise: Automating Web Tests Using Selenium IDE**

Create a small test suite of tests for De Anza's Online Searchable Schedule page. Each test's passing criteria is that this class appears in the search results. Below are the TDS summaries for each test case:

Course Type: Hybrid Classes Course Num: 74 Course Title: quality assurance Time of Day: evening Day of Week: Monday & Wednesday Instructor: pumphrey Location: AT204

All six fields filled in with data: Hybrid Classes, 74, quality assurance, Evening, Monday & Wednesday, pumphrey, AT204 To submit this assignment, upload 9 HTML files--the test suite HTML file plus the eight individual test case HTML files.

**Note**: These updated tests were **NOT** turned in, but they do contain some asserts that should have been included with the original submissions.
